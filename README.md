Simulating a round robin chess tournament based on the probabilities of wining/drawing or losing a game (calculated through the ELO rating system)

This is a project i started about a year ago (during one of the Meltwater Championship tournaments). This week i revisited this because of the 2nd edition of the very same tournament.
The rating List (the exel file) is no longer up to date. However i chose not to update it yet because i know all the participating players of one event of last years tournament are in that list.
This is just the round robin phase initialy i wanted to include a knockout phase but gave up on it when i coulnÂ´t resolve the problem of the weird results mentioned on the description of the code file. That however should be easy to include (will probably do it when i find the time)
